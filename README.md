*As a student of magic, you have the unique ability to create spells of your own design, using techniques taught to you by the Headmaster Wizard, who oversees the day-to-day operations of the Arcane University. Eventually he begins to take a keen interest in your talents, and one day decides to teach you a special spell to help him run a very special errand.*

#### Overview

In Spellbound, you learn and discover techniques, which can be combined to create custom spells using a dynamic particle and magic system. Each technique affects a specific property or behavior of the spell. For example, a basic fireball spell might be created by combining the Propulsion, Collision and Ignition techniques. That is, the spell propels itself towards a target, then collides with and ignites it in a burst of flame. Chain two or more spells together to create powerful combinations, or merge them to cast two simultaneously.

Explore a large, open world with dungeons, caves and monsters. Collect magic crystals to fuel your spellcrafting, or sell them to a shopkeeper for gold coins.

Keep up with your studies and never stop practicing magic. Soon, you'll become the wizard you were meant to be.
